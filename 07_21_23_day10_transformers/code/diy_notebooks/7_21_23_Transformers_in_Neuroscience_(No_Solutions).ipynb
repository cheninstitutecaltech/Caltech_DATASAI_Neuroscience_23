        "\n",
        "<p align = \"justify\">Transformer neural networks are sequence-to-sequence models, they take in a set of inputs and return a set of outputs (usually of the same length). Because they are such a general building block, there is no limit to the types of things that these models can do. For example, feature selection, generative modeling, denoising, and even reinforcement learning. They were originally designed for natural language processing (NLP), a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, generate, and interact with human language in a meaningful way. Since then, they have not only been widely used in NLP, but have also shown promise in many other domains, such as computer vision, time series modeling, and even neuroscience.</p>\n",

        "<br></br>\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align = \"justify\">Previously, neural network architectures have been specialized for the domain of interest. For example, with sequential data, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were often used, and for images, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were often used. However, in 2017 that all changed with the paper, \"<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\">Attention Is All You Need</a>\" in which the original transformer was introduced. The original goal of the model was machine translation (translate a sentence from one language to another), but others found that this simple architecture can be applied to far more than just NLP. Let's now take a look at the architecture this model was designed to replace, the RNN.\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align = \"justify\">In an RNN, each input is given to the model independently and must follow the sequential ordering of the data, e.g. you must process <code>input_1</code> before <code>input_2</code>. In order for information from <code>input_1</code> to affect the output of <code>input_2</code>, we must have a way for the model to remember what was important from <code>input_1</code> and keep it in memory. We call this memory the \"<i>hidden state</i>\". We can only fit so much into the hidden state, so eventually you will need to forget some things.</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align = \"justify\">One of the main advantages that transformers have over RNNs is that they do not have this sequential bottleneck, i.e. <b>information is not routed through a hidden state, but is directly exchanged between inputs</b>. This can be exteremly useful in situations where \"forgetting\" things about the previous inputs can be detrimental to the model's performance.</p>\n",

        "<br></br>\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align = \"justify\">In the NLP example above, we can see that when trying to predict the next word with the RNN, we only have information from the hidden state. With the transformer however, we can pull information from any words in the sequence! </p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align = \"justify\">This routing of information across the tokens is accomplished through the use of: <b><i>Self-Attention,</i></b> more specifically, <b><i>Scaled Dot Product Attention</i></b>. Let's now take a closer look at this \"attention\" mechanism and how it works...</p>\n",

In the example below, the inputs are words. To feed these words into a neural network we must first convert them into numbers so the network can process them. This is accomplished through the use of <b>word embeddings</b>.</p>\n",

        "3. Is it related to **animals**?   \n",
        "\n",

        "1. **Animals**: Closer to -1 means the word is less often related to animals, closer to +1 means the word is often realted to animals\n",

This is called, *Teacher Forcing*, and is a technique that helps the model train faster by limiting the effects that an incorrect prediction will have on the future. Because of the sequential dependences of the RNN, a mistake early on will propagate throughout the entire sequence. However with teacher forcing, the model is only tasked with predicting the next word not the entire sequence again!\n",

If each token's optimal output is simply the next word (the token immediately to its right), and if the MHA architecture allows for the flow of information across tokens, could the next token's word simply be \"pulled in\"? This is where the beauty of the masking feature comes in. Despite the interconnection of tokens within the MHA, the 'masked' part ensures that a token is 'blind' to what comes next. In essence, each token has access only to the tokens that precede it, its 'past', so to speak. This keeps the integrity of the learning process intact and ensures that every token effectively learns its place in the sequence.\n",

        "3. **Positional Encoding**: a way to indicate the position of words in a sentence. This is because the transformer architecture operates on *sets*, this means that it is unphased by a shuffling of the input tokens and will always return the same result. Positional encoding is a way to indicate the position of words in a sentence. It's based on sine and cosine functions which generate a unique but consistent positional signal.\n",

        "<p align = \"justify\">This paper presents a new technique called the Spatial Redundancy Denoising Transformer (SRDTrans) to improve the quality of fluorescence microscopy images. Fluorescence microscopy, including techniques like calcium imaging, can be negatively affected by factors such as labeling concentration, brightness of the dye, and photobleaching. The noise introduced by these factors can make the resulting images difficult to interpret.</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align = \"justify\">The SRDTrans method is a self-supervised technique that improves image quality by reducing noise. Unlike previous methods, it doesn't rely on the similarity between consecutive frames but instead uses a \"spatial redundancy sampling strategy.\" This means it uses data from the original image in two different orientations to train itself. SRDTrans is based on a network architecture known as a transformer, which unlike traditional methods, can maintain high resolution while using fewer computational resources.</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align = \"justify\">Applied to calcium imaging, the SRDTrans method was able to effectively reduce noise and recover structures that were previously hard to distinguish, such as soma, neurites, and vascular shadows. Importantly, it was also able to restore most of the frequency components that other methods lose, leading to better denoising performance. This indicates that SRDTrans could be a powerful tool for improving the quality of calcium imaging data, and potentially other fluorescence microscopy techniques as well.</p>\n",

In a single instance of spatial redundancy sampling, the original low-SNR stack of H×W×T pixels is sampled by orthogonal masks, producing three downsampled sub-stacks (input, target 1, and target 2) of H/2×W/2×T pixels. The “input” sub-stack is fed into the transformer network, and the corresponding output is compared with the “target” sub-stacks to calculate the loss function for parameter optimization.</i></p>\n",

It consists of a temporal encoder module, a spatiotemporal transformer block (STB), and a temporal decoder module. Each temporal encoder compresses the temporal scale (t) of the input by a factor of r (adjustable and set as 4 in this work) using convolution. In the STB module, the input is divided into small patches, and different feature maps of the same spatial position are stitched together in the patch flattening layer. The position embedding layer records the spatial position of each patch so that it can be mapped back after the global interaction in the multi-head self-attention layer. The self-attention mechanism can calculate the spatiotemporal correlation between all local patches. Then the output patches are remapped to their original spatial positions. The output of the STB module will be uncompressed to the original temporal scale by the following temporal decoder module. Multiple skip connections are configured to stabilize the training of the network.</i></p>\n",

The transformer model, unlike the sequential nature of LFADS, processes all inputs together in layers, allowing it to avoid sequential bottlenecks.

Another option is to try with your own data, the genral principle of attention and the transformer architecture can be applied out of the box to many neuroscience problems like it was here today.\n"
